# odin-recipes

Here, I will be using all the HTML knowledge I have learned so far to create a simple webpage containing recipes of my favorite foods. Additionally, I will be using all the basic Git knowledge I know to create snapshots of my code, comment on changes I have made, and upload to Github when I am finished.
