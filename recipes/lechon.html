        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>An entire piglet</li>
                <li>Apple</li>
                <li>Lemon grass</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Lots of salt and pepper</li>
                <li>Garlic cloves</li>
                <li>Oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Properly prepare the piglet and spit. This involves gutting the pig and making sure it won't fall off the spit roast, as it will spin several hundred times during cooking.</li>
                <li>Leave a cavity on the pig starting from the ventral side, just under the base of its head, all the way down to the bottom part of its stomach region. </li>
                <li>Prepare your seasonings. Grind and chop the onions and garlic cloves in a pot with oil, and shove them, along with the lemon grass, inside the cavity you made.</li>
                <li>Close your cavity using cotton threads or butcher's twine. Stainless steel strings also work</li>
                <li>Attach your pig to the spit roast and leave it spinning until it's your desired color.</li>
                <li>Take out it out of the roast and put an apple in the piglet's mouth for presentation</li>
            </ol>
